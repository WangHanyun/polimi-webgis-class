# GIS 2024 - Politecnico di Milano
Repository for the Web Development part of the GIS lessons 2023 - 2024.

The contents of this repository are entirely for learning purposes. All contents and code is completely open and available and based on open-source software.

Students are encouraged to fork and and modify this template as much as they want.

## Installing
Clone the repository using the command 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Diuke/polimi-webgis-class-2024
```

Or fork the repository for having your own copy or download via https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BK8PFmAw73GyklnTM9Of6Q with code:7gg8

This application uses npm as the package manager and Vite as the web server.
It uses Node version 16 or higher.

First, install the dependencies using the command:
```sh
npm install
```

Run the project using the command.
```sh
npm run start
```

This will start a Vite server. Open the application in http://localhost:5173/

Using Vite it is possible to follow the examples of OpenLayers, as well as use more advanced TypeScript and Visual Studio Code capabilities, such 
as intellisense, fast reload, documentation, and code completion.

## Building
Run the command 
```sh
npm run build
```

This will re-create the folder /docs with all the necessary files for hosting the website in GitHub Pages.

Modify the configuration file (vite.config.js) for different build configurations and folder structures.
This is a dummy project and is not intended to be a one-fits-all configuration.
