By analyzing the DTM and derived data such as slope from the study area, we can observe a gradual decrease in elevation towards the southwest, with the terrain becoming relatively flat. This area also has a relatively high population density. In the Landslide Susceptibility Map, we can see that most parts of the study area are high-risk zones, while the "flat areas" with higher population concentration are at a lower risk.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Screenshot 2024-07-03 145036.png" alt="" /></span>Although the population density is high in low-risk areas, these areas also have relatively small land coverage. In contrast, high-risk areas have a lower population density but cover a large area. Overall, the majority of people living in the study area are still in high-risk zones. Preventive measures within the study area need to focus on these high-risk zones, while also not neglecting the protection of medium, low, and very high-risk areas.<br>During the experiment, we found that the "flat area" in the southwest corner of the study region was so flat that the slope obtained from the DTM was 0. This led to blank data in subsequent processing, even in the final results. This was very frustrating for us. We spent a lot of time investigating the cause of these blanks. We were too focused on our own "self-exploration" and forgot to communicate with our supervisor. In future research and studies, I think we should seek advice from others more often and not be shy about asking for help.</p>
